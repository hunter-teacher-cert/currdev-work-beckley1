### What is the course?

Intro to Media. This is a class that I am creating new this year. It is for 8th graders and focuses on audio production for podcasting/sound engineering/music recording. I have a few students who have experience in some sort of sound design but for the most part this is completely new for the students.

### What is the language?

I will be using Scratch for most of the coding aspects for this class.

### How does one write & run code in this language?

Scratch is block-based coding that runs (as long as it is given the run command block) directly in the Scratch console. 

### Rate the complexity of the syntax?

As far as coding would go, I guess I would put Scratch in the easiest coding syntax. The syntax is provided by the command blocks and the blocks only fit together if they are related to each other in type.

### Strengths

- Can be easily understood and implemented by students possessing a wide variety of prior knowledge, skills, and strengths. 
- Can be done on Chromebooks (that's all my students have access to until we get a class set of laptops).
- Easy to import recorded sound files to.
- Stores their work in the cloud so no worries about losing files and shedding tears.

### How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?

I can give demonstrations with higher level coding to show my own projects off and to illustrate that very complicated programs/animations can be done with block coding while at the same time allow students who don't want to do as much to stay with simpler code that will still give them a sense of accomplishment. As far as them being on Chromebooks, it will help them understand what they can do with limited technology.

### Weaknesses

- Class is at the mercy of how well the network is working at any given time. Our wifi network drops frequently and students have issues accessing different wi-fi points when they move to different parts of the building.
- Is not as versatile as some of the software I'd actually like to be using for more specific needs of the class. In a perfect world, each student would be on a Windows/Linux based laptop to use Sonic Pi for synth creation.

### How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?

Using Scratch seems to be the best way to mitigate having to use Chromebooks for coding. Nothing I can do about the wifi issues. 

### Why did you select this language for this class?

Honestly, it's pretty much the only optionn we have for what I am trying to do with the class. I am looking into some other online synth sites but some are license based or not ED2D compliant.
