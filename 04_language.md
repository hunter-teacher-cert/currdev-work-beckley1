### What is the course?

Intro to Media. This is a class that I am creating new this year. It is for 8th graders and focuses on audio production for podcasting/sound engineering/music recording. I have a few students who have experience in some sort of sound design but for the most part this is completely new for the students.

### What is the language?

I will be using Scratch for most of the coding aspects for this class.

### How does one write & run code in this language?

Scratch is block-based coding that runs (as long as it is given the run command block) directly in the Scratch console. 

### Rate the complexity of the syntax?
