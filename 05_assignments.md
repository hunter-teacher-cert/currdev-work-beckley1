# Assignments for Unit Plan

### For both of these assignments we will be using Soundtrap to create a podcast intro that will consist of opening theme music, an introduction of the podcaster(s) and the theme of the show, and a quick "advertisment"

## Assignment 1

This assignment would be introducing the students to creating music through loops, adding tracks, and manipulating the DAW to cut, splice, and loop their tracks.

- Begin with an introduction of going through different instruments, drum samples, and musical loops.
- Students will be put into small groups and will each group will be placed at one of the recording workstations.
- Roles will be assigned to each student. 
** 1. The Engineer: This person will be responsible for adding the tracks and manipulating the mouse/keyboard and do what the musician asks.
** 2. The Musician: This person will instruct the Engineer what instrument they want to lay down and then perofrm on the attached midi keyboard while the Engineer records it.
** 3. The Slacker (I don't know what medium we will use for this yet as Slack is blocked but I will forever think of this person as the Slacker now!): This person will be responsible for taking notes for the rest of the class about anything of note that they discovered, problems they encountered, or tricks they uncovered.
- Reconvene with 10 minutes to go to discuss findings.


## Assignment 2

This assignment would be an extension of the first but would focus on the hardware we are using (microphones, sound mixers, sampler pads, keyboards, etc.).

This assignment is something I wrote up for our Dryden grant. The assignment and lesson plan can be seen [here.](Audio Mixer.docx)
