*NB I have chosen to use the alternative assignment even though I teach in a middle school. My current program (and as far as I know it will be this way for the long term) doesn't have anything in common with any of the given curriculum.*

Instructions:

## Compare two of the APCSP curricula that were linked in the Async portion of the assignment.

I will be comparing code.org's curriculum to that of CodeHS.

### Major differences

 It seems like the code.org curriculum has a more linear scope and sequence, one unit leading into the next with previous content used for each next step up. The CodeHS curriculum appears to be more of a "pick and choose" units as required/desired. The CodeHS units are called 'Mini Courses' which leads me to think they can be taught as standalone lessons/units. I have used code.org before and from my experience it relies heavily on the order of the units. Also from my reading, CodeHS is more based in block code javascript whereas code.org has different "Labs" that incorporate a few different languages.
* I believe there is a different approach in how the material is presented. At least from my viewing of both syllabi there are more non-computer, hands on activities in the code.org curriculum whereas CodeHS is almost entirely web-based.

### Major similiarities

* Both are AP CSP endorsed.
* Both are chunked up to teach in a variety of different settings and timeframes.
* Both involve creating projects that appeal to students.
* Both provide the teacher with necessary lesson plans/rubrics/necessary files/etc.


### Comparative streangths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).

They both seem to be very project based. When looking through the CodeHS curriculum I was more impressed with the actual projects. As a musician, I loved looking through the music creation unit. It seems like the CodeHS is very product based. Code.org has a lot of different directions to take students into the areas of more artistic creation but may be later in the class. 

### Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?

Yes! For sure! I had never seen the CodeHS curriculum. My class I'm teaching is a tech class where the students are doing mostly audio recording/engineering. I think I can definitely incorporate the Coding in Music Syllabus from CodeHS into our audio lab.
