* This lesson uses a [worksheet](https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/currdev-work-beckley1/blob/2b6e01dcb9af47960b302a104d6300a628ba4577/Grade%207%20-%20The%20Power%20of%20Digital%20Footprints%20-%20My%20Digital%20Footprint%20Student%20Handout.docx) where students write down  websites that they log in to on a regular basis.

I normally have them take the sheet and put them up to the monitor of their Chromebooks and trace logos of the sites they visit most.

* After they have finished their footprint we have a class discussion about methods one might use to keep their data safe and their identities as secret as possible.
