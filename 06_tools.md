# Tools

*Desribe 2 technological tools you currently use in your classroom. One of which should be a programming tool (if possible). Include:*

## Tool 1
___
*_The name of the tool:_*

#### 12 Channel Audio Mixer 

___

*_What its general purpose is:_*

#### Even though we also have Yeti Blu microphones that can be used directly via usb into Soundtrap, students are using a hardware mixer to have a more physical example of what an audio engineer does in a studio setting.

___

*_The class you use it in:_*

#### Intro to Media

___

*_How you use it in class:_*

#### The mixer hooks up to the student engineer's Chromebook via USB and powers the condenser mics used for podcast recordings. I also use the mixers to illustrate the physicality of music recording that will help them when they eventually move to using just software based buttons and knobs.

___

*_Why you have selected that tool for that purpose?_*

#### The mixing boards are a great way to get students to understand how gain, volume, panning, special effects, etc. can be used to make their podcasts sound better.

___

## Tool 2

___

*_The name of the tool:_*

___

#### [Soundtrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/)

___

*_What its general purpose is:_*

#### Soundtrap is a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) that allows the students to record and then mix, master, and export the morning announcement podcasts that they have written.

___

*_The class you use it in:_*

#### Intro to Media

___

*_How you use it in class:_*


#### We use Soundtrap to add special effects and mastering effects to the finished recordings that the students have initially used the hardware mixers for.

___

*_Why you have selected that tool for that purpose?_*

#### Unfortunately, we are somewhat tethered to using a web-based DAW as Chromebooks are all we have available in the school. There is one PC lab that is used by the art teachers but there always classes in that lab.
