# Intro to Media

## General description of the course

This course will be using hardware and software that will allow groups and individuals to take turns being the engineers, hosts, composers, and writers of a morning podcast that will be played for the entire middle school to replace the current morning announcements. It will also incorporate an introductory level of both block programming (using Scratch) and P5 in order to create music for the podcasts.

## Target audience

The entire Middle School (including the District Office)

## Where it fits along with the other courses in your school

The course would be an 8th grade introduction to digital media. Students are given the option in 9th grade to take an art class called "Digital Media" that focuses on the visual aspect of recording. My intro course would prepare students who may want to go further the next year by allowing them the opportunity to incorporate their knowledge of using a DAW for audio recording into their video productions.
